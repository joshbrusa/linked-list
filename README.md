# linked-list

Simple example usage of a linked list.

## Run

```bash
task run
```

## Advantages

- Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically, as memory
  allocation is done at runtime.
- Insertion and Deletion: Adding or removing elements from a linked list is
  efficient, especially for large lists.
- Flexibility: Linked lists can be easily reorganized and modified without
  requiring a contiguous block of memory.

## Disadvantages

- Random Access: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not allow direct access to
  elements by index. Traversal is required to reach a specific node.
- Extra Memory: Linked lists require additional memory for storing the pointers,
  compared to arrays.
